# LinearKalmanFilter

This repository consists implementation of a simple kalman filter. To run this, directly run kalman.m and check out the plots. 

The main thing to observe is that the estimated states are much smoother and less random than the measured states.

The file kalmanmultiple.m is a code when multiple sensors are used as an input to the kalman filter. As an example I have used 2 GPS sensors and estimated the states.
